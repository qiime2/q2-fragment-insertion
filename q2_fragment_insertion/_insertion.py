# For future devs: Choice of default values for alignment_subset_size and
# placement_subset_size was done by Siavash Mirarab (the developer of SEPP).
# His justification is as follows:
# SEPP has two main parameters. In the default version used for Greengenes and
# incorporated into QIIME2, the reference tree is divided into 62 "placement"
# subsets, each with at most 5000 leaves, and each placement subset is further
# divided into alignment subsets of at most 1000 leaves to build the HMM
# ensamples (292 alignment subsets in total). These choices are driven by
# computational constraints; increasing the placement subset size (which is in
# theory desirable) puts a high burden on the memory, and reducing the
# alignment subset could increase the running time with very little
# improvement in the accuracy of results (Mirarab et al. 2012).
