IMPORTANT WARNING
This is RAxML version 8.1.24 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on June 29 2015.

Alignment has 1285 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 4.51%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 user-specified trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
